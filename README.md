# Overview

This project aims to create a lightweight, modular, and extensible operating
system based on the microkernel architecture. The microkernel design minimizes
the kernel's complexity by delegating most tasks to userspace services,
resulting in improved reliability, security, and maintainability.

In addition, this operating system aims to allow a large language model
(LLM) to interact with the system. What this means is that an AI will have the
eventual ability to interact with the user interface.

As its name suggests, this operating system thematically revolves around
[Neuro-sama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-sama), an artificial
intelligence streamer created by [vedal987](https://twitter.com/vedal987).
References from the stream and the community will make an appearance.

Lastly, to ensure compatibility with UNIX and its derivatives, this operating
system will try to adhere to the [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)
specification. This will ease the porting of software from those systems.

# Development

If you're interested in developing the operating system, follow the outlined
steps. Make sure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed on your
system.

## Prerequisites

Before developing, ensure you have Nix installed on your host operating system:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

## Cloning

Spawn an interactive shell that contains the `git` package:

```bash
nix-shell -p git
```

Clone the repository to your local machine by using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Theomund/NeurOS.git
```

## Developing

To instantiate a development shell, run the following command:

```bash
nix develop
```

## Compiling

Run the following command to generate an ISO image:

```bash
zig build
```

This command will start the build process based on the configured settings
and source code.

## Running

To run the compiled operating system in a virtual machine, run this
command:

```bash
zig build run
```

This command will start QEMU and run the operating system.

## Debugging

To debug the operating system, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
zig build run -Ddebug=true
```

This will start QEMU with the flags needed to use a debugger such
as GDB.

In another terminal, run the following command:

```bash
zig build debug
```

This starts GDB with the correct symbol file and connection parameters.

## Cleaning

To clean the build artifacts and start fresh, use the following command:

```bash
zig build clean
```

This command removes compiled binaries and temporary files.
